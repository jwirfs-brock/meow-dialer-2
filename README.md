I created this simple prototype for CSCI5849 as an exercise to learn basic HTML, Javascript and CSS.
The focus of this assignment was to work with events and understand how we can use them to model gestures.

## Credits:
The design is based on [this tutorial](https://shaunkane.github.io/csci4849-spring2018/a2-events/) by Shaun Kane.

All sounds are from [Freesound](https://freesound.org/), with either a Creative Commons Attribution license or in the public domain, from users [TRNGLE](https://freesound.org/people/TRNGLE/sounds/368010/), [steffcaffrey](https://freesound.org/people/steffcaffrey/sounds/262309/), [lockwert](https://freesound.org/people/lockwert/sounds/163286/), [swatkamus](https://freesound.org/people/swatkamus/sounds/260179/), [Department64](https://freesound.org/people/Department64/sounds/64006/), [CGEffex](https://freesound.org/people/CGEffex/sounds/89503/), [Chocktaw](https://freesound.org/people/Chocktaw/sounds/220018/), [castrathica](https://freesound.org/people/castrathica/sounds/54058/), [josepharaoh99](https://freesound.org/people/josepharaoh99/sounds/362953/), [ebcrosby](https://freesound.org/people/ebcrosby/sounds/334433/), [NoiseCollector](https://freesound.org/people/NoiseCollector/sounds/4913/), [tuberatanka](https://freesound.org/people/tuberatanka/sounds/110010/)

Javascript code for playing a sound when a button is clicked is from [Siong-Ui Te's guide](https://siongui.github.io/2012/10/08/javascript-play-sound-onclick/).

This [article from StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6239609/how-to-dynamically-change-the-color-of-the-selected-menu-item-of-a-web-page) helped me figure out how to style the active tabs.
